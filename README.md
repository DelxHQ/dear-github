#### Dear GitHub,
Recently, a user, namely [@DALTONTASTIC](https://github.com/Daltontastic) abused his admin rights on the ImagicalMine organisation. He deleted the whole organisation and every repository with it. Today we would like you to bring us to justice. We would like to tell all the other organisations out there to review who has admin rights in order to stop the same situation happening to them.
We would also like you to:
- Recover all our settings
- Recover all our repos, commits, etc.
- Stop other users from abusing admin rights

Any other owner and member of their own organisation would have written the same letter to you. We hope that this user doesn't get to destruct any further to affect other organisations and repositories. Thank you.

Best regards,
Imagical Corporation, ImagicalMine Team and a [whole lot of other ImagicalMine users and community](https://github.com/ImagicalCorp/dear-github/blob/master/users.md)

**Wish to sign the letter, and prevent any other "admin rights abusers"? Read more [here](https://github.com/ImagicalCorp/dear-github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).**
